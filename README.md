This is a ros package for the traversal of a real-time bot in a maze. We placed an aruco marker on top of the bot and obtained the pose of the robot using aruco detection in OpenCV. Applied Image Thresholding technique to find the walkable path for the bot and applied A-star algorithm to find the shortest path for the bot to reach the destination.
